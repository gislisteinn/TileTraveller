#We start by making 2 variables one that keeps track of how high the user is and another that keeps track of how much to the sides he goes
#Lets call them H and W and start them both at 1
#We use a while loop so the game continues to run until he hits tile W3 and H1
#At any point if his W is 1 he can only travel east, if its 3 he can only travel west and if it is 2 he can travel both ways
#If his H is 1 he can only travel north and if it is 3 he can only travel south, if it is 2 he can travel both ways
#Make sure the users input always get interpreted as a lowercase letter
#Lets make a function to control his movements
#We make restrictions for the middle boxes and the directions he cannot go
#We end the game when he hits W3 H1
